## Install

This driver is based on Node.js technology, you thus need to install node.js first in your computer: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
Note: this driver can be directly installed on the Neeo brain provided that you root it first. PLease consult the following repository to get more information: https://github.com/jac459/NeeoDriversInBrain.
Note that installing the driver in the brain is more complex overall and it is recommanded to start by using a computer or a raspberry ideally.

In order to install, download the zip of the repository (by clicking the green "code" button) and download in your target computer (or brain).
unzip it and run:
```npm install```
This command will install the driver and all the dependancies. You need to have an internet access in order to download the dependancies.

To run the driver you can either type:
```npm start```
or
```node meta```

## How this driver work ?

This driver is dynamically using JSON setting files (device files) in order to create various drivers loaded in the neeo brain.
A few examples of drivers are provided in 'activated' and 'disactivated' folders.
Any file put in the 'activated' folder will be interpreted in order to generate a new driver.
One advantage of this approach is that resources are well centralised and are supposed to have lesser impact on the brain.
Also, if you run from a Raspberry, the max number I have been able to load is 8 devices. Using this driver you can load as many drivers as you need.
Another advantage is that there is only one code base running all the drivers so it will be theoretically easier to track bugs.
Simple drivers will have very simple device files but explect a bit more complexity for advanced interactions.

The target with this driver is to create a set of "device files" in order to continue to support many new devices when the neeo cloud will close.

## How to use

When you run of the driver, the driver will scan your "activated" folder and try to load any device placed here.
 
IMPORTANT: On the first run, the driver will detact your Neeo Brain and create a 'config.js' file in order to store its IP and Port. If you have problem connecting, make sure to delete the "config.js" file and run again. If you have still can't and the port is taken, you can manually edit the config.js file and change the port number (any arbitrary number). 

If the driver is correctly loaded, you can go to your Neeo App and search for the name of the driver you created.

To use the driver without creating your own device files, you just need to know that and put the device files you are interrested on the "activated" folder and restart the driver. You will now be able to run them on the remote.

## Tutorial : Creating your own devices

Note: you should have a basic understanding of JSON. JSON is an extremly simple file format, with an "Attribute" : "Value" concept. This tutorial will not explain JSON as such but you shouldn't be affraid of it, it really is very simple.

### Tutorial Step 1 - Simple buttons device

In order to create your single button device you can use the following sample file:
```
{"name":"Tuto Step1", 
    "manufacturer":"Your Name",
    "version":1,
    "type":"AVRECEIVER", 
    "buttons":{
      "CURSOR LEFT": {"label":"", "type":"http-get", "command":"http://192.168.1.33:6095/controller?action=keyevent&keycode=left"},
      "CURSOR RIGHT": {"label":"", "type":"http-get", "command":"http://192.168.1.33:6095/controller?action=keyevent&keycode=right"},
      "CURSOR UP": {"label":"", "type":"http-get", "command":"http://192.168.1.33:6095/controller?action=keyevent&keycode=up"},
      "CURSOR DOWN": {"label":"", "type":"http-get", "command":"http://192.168.1.33:6095/controller?action=keyevent&keycode=down"}
    }
}
```
Let's have a look on the file and understand each fieds:
- name : this is the name your device will have, you will be able to find it by this name in the remote.
- manufacturer : put the brand of the device you will control here.
- version : IMPORTANT /!\ /!\ Once a device is first created, its structure is set. If you add new buttons and you want the remote to notice, you will need to delete the device and recreate the device (not convenient) OR just increment the version number. In the future, if you add an item and get frustrated because the remote doens't seems to care, remember this version field. NOTE: you can not edit or delete a button by incrementing the version, you will need to delete and reload the device.
- type : IMPORTANT /!\ /!\ This field is also important, it will drive the way your remote will interpret your device. The problem is that not all features are supported for all devices. For example, if you want to use the channel button, you can't use a light device type, you will need a AVRECEIVER or TV type for example. As a simple way to create, I like to use the AVRECEIVER, you have to make it appears in the remote by activating it in the recipes part (choose SHOW) but it is quite flexible and support most of the interactions.If you see warning lines when you run the device, it is because in this example you didn't declare INPUT buttons while your device is an AVRECEIVER. It doesn't matter but it shows you how neeo reacts. You can dive into the neeo SDK in order to better understand the limitation of each device (note that the documentation is incomplete).
The type you can choose from are: ACCESSORY, AUDIO, AVRECEIVER, DVB (aka. satellite receiver), DVD (aka. disc player), GAMECONSOLE, HDMISWITCH, LIGHT, MEDIAPLAYER, MUSICPLAYER, PROJECTOR, TUNER, TV, VOD (aka. Video-On-Demand box like Apple TV, Fire TV...), SOUNDBAR.
- buttons : You have here the list of the buttons. The name can be any name and you can change the display name in the "label" attribute. Some buttons are recognised by the remote control. It is specially handy if you want to map a feature to an hardware button like the cursor. In this example, you can use the cursor arows of the remote directly.
The list of the recognise buttons is presented here : https://github.com/NEEOInc/neeo-sdk#neeo-macro-names. Please note that this list is incomplete and you can discover other buttons by browsing planet-neeo forum or the widgets description. It is anyway a good start.
- type (in buttons) : This field is very important as it will drive the protocole used for your device. In this example, it is just an http request (GET). The supported types are: http-get, http-post, webSocket (works with socket.io), static, cli and http-get-soap. Examples on each types will be provided. More types will be added in the future.
- command: Here you put the url you want to call. This is a very simpe and efficient to control a device, much faster and reliable than with Infra Red control. A lot of devices are exposing directly an API and you just have to copy paste your URL in the command field (inside the quotes). For example, here you can find an easy way to control your Xiaomi TV: https://github.com/spocky/mireco#gitv-http-api-featuresdocumentation or here , your yamaha receiver: http://habitech.s3.amazonaws.com/PDFs/YAM/MusicCast/Yamaha%20MusicCast%20HTTP%20simplified%20API%20for%20ControlSystems.pdf. You are often just a google search away. 
Note: for more complexe devices, you can download an intermediary driver, exposing a REST API. So this meta driver will use this driver to remote control. I use such a driver in Python to control my Xbox One X. The resulting performance is excellent (instant reaction).

### Tutorial Step 2 - Label device

This first step was easy but very boring. Let's have a bit more fun. Now we will have 2 buttons controlling what a label display.
Let's have a look at the code:
```
{"name":"Tuto Step2", 
    "manufacturer":"Your Name",
    "version":2,
    "type":"AVRECEIVER", 
    "variables":{
      "LabelStatus":"Default value"
    },
    "labels":{
      "CurrentStatus" : {"label":"status", "listen":"LabelStatus"}
    },  
   
    "buttons":{
      "CURSOR LEFT": {"label":"", "type":"static", "command":"It works on the left", "evalwrite":[{"variable":"LabelStatus","value":"$Result"}]},
      "CURSOR RIGHT": {"label":"", "type":"static", "command":"On the right too", "evalwrite":[{"variable":"LabelStatus","value":"$Result"}]}
    }
}
```
#### variables
In this example we introduce a major concept which is the variables.
The variable is very important but itself, it is of no use. 
"LabelStatus":"Default value" => the LabelStatus is an arbitrary name that you choose (in one word please) . The 'default value' is a ... default value that you choose. Can be empty.
#### label
Then in the label part. You see an arbitrary name (CurrentStatus, one word), a label name, if you want to change the label, and then the most important:
- listen: in this important field, you put the name of a variable. After, each time you assign a value to this variable, the label will have this value.
#### evalwrite
This is a new feature we can attach to a button (or any actionnable component). 
- evalwrite: evalwrite allows you to write a value in a variable. There is a lot of complex way to do it, but in this simple example, we will use a very special variable:
- $Result: $Result is a specific variable being assigned the result of the command. In this example, it is very easy because the command is of type "static". With an http-get you would get the result of the call, but with a type static, it just copies the value inserted in command. 
- evalwrite (2) : Comming back to evalwrite, this function just copy in the "variable", the "value" part. 
  /!\ IMPORTANTE NOTE: You can have multiple evalwrite triggered. The code would look like that: "evalwrite":[{"variable":"LabelStatus","value":"$Result"}, {"variable":"anotherVariable","value":"AnotherValue"}]. Each evalwrite is between [...], indicating an array, and then as normally: {...}. So basically to have an array with 2 evalwrite, it will look like that: [{...}, [{...}].

### Tutorial Step 3 - Let's go to something more complex...
Let's extend the previous example. Now we will have a button up and down. These buttons, changes the value of a switch and the switch changes the value of 2 pictures
```
{"name":"Tuto Step3", 
    "manufacturer":"Your Name",
    "version":3,
    "type":"AVRECEIVER", 
    "variables":{
      "LabelStatus":"Default value",
      "Power":false,
      "AlbumURI": "",
      "URI1": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jac459/metadriver/master/AVReceiver/DSP/ThemeStandard/chamber_sce.jpg",
      "URI2": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jac459/metadriver/master/AVReceiver/DSP/ThemeStandard/surr_decoder_sce.jpg"
    },
    "labels":{
      "CurrentStatus" : {"label":"status", "listen":"LabelStatus"}
    }, 
    "images":{
           "AlbumCover" : {"label":"", "size" : "large", "listen":"AlbumURI"},
           "AlbumThumb" : {"label":"", "size" : "small", "listen":"AlbumURI"}
           },
       
    "switches":{
      "PowerSwitch" : {"label":"", "listen":"Power", "evaldo":[{"test":"DYNAMIK $Result", "then":"__SHOWIMAGE1", "or":"__SHOWIMAGE2"}]}
    },
    "buttons":{
      "CURSOR LEFT": {"label":"", "type":"static", "command":"It works on the left", "evalwrite":[{"variable":"LabelStatus","value":"$Result"}]},
      "CURSOR RIGHT": {"label":"", "type":"static", "command":"On the right too", "evalwrite":[{"variable":"LabelStatus","value":"$Result"}]},
      "CURSOR UP": {"label":"", "type":"static", "command":true, "evalwrite":[{"variable":"Power","value":"$Result"}]},
      "CURSOR DOWN": {"label":"", "type":"static", "command":false, "evalwrite":[{"variable":"Power","value":"$Result"}]},
      "__SHOWIMAGE1": {"label":"", "type":"static", "command":"", "evalwrite":[{"variable":"AlbumURI","value":"$URI1"}]},
      "__SHOWIMAGE2": {"label":"", "type":"static", "command":"", "evalwrite":[{"variable":"AlbumURI","value":"$URI2"}]}
    }
}
```
#### The image element
The image element is quite straight forward, it displays a picture.
- label: the picture label, name if not provided.
- size: can be small or large.
- listen: the listen is attached to a variable, like the label, but it has to be an URL pointing on a jpg if you want something to be displayed. Recommanded size of the pic is 480x480px for a big image and 100x100px for a small.
#### The switch element.
The switch element is a bit more complex. You can assign it some commands and you can control it like a label with a "listen" attribute. The accepted value will be either false or true. /!\ In JSON, false and true are NOT between double quote ". So you directly have true or false (cf the example). With the switch, we introduce a new element which is evaldo. evaldo can be also present in a button. Meaning a button can have bothe evaldo and evalwrite. On the contrary, a switch can only have evaldo. When evalwrite is here to write into variables, evaldo is there to perform an action (triggering a button).
#### evaldo
In evaldo, you have:
- test: this test can be true or false (more on it later).
- do: the name of the button to be triggered if the result is true. If you don't want a button to be visible but you want to be able to call it, just prefix it by "__" like int the example.
- or:the name of the button to be triggered if the result is false. 
- DYNAMIK. In this example, you have seen a weird expression: DYNAMIK $Result. This is because the $Result in this driver can only be a string. So here the $Result will be "true" for example if the switch is on the right. In fact we don't need it to be "true" (like the string true) but true (like the boolean value). So we ask the driver to interpret the string value and transform it in a real boolean. In the next steps, we will see a lot of powerful and more complex usage of DYNAMIK keyword.
/!\ IMPORTANTE NOTE: This DYNAMIK feature is extremely powerful and is available on many fields. It truely allows to adapt to many real world situation in order to manage various different devices. The drawback is that it generates 'in theory' a security issue because it allows to inject code into the metadriver. For this reason, you should avoid running the driver as an administrator (and you don't have any reason to do that).
Note 2: In this example, you see how variables are used in a field. It is just $ before the name of the variable so the driver knows it is a variable ($MyVariable). 
IMPORTANT: Don't use 'nested' names for variables. For example if you have a variable MyVariable and MyVariable2, if you write in a field $MyVariable2, the driver will understand it as Myvariable and '2'. So for example if the value of $MyVariable is Hello, you will endup with Hello2.

### Tutorial Step 4 - Starting with real life example: controlling a MiTV (Xiaomi).

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XNF1mSqwuo

In order to have more advanced interactions, let's see how the driver analyses MiTV' answers.

```
{"name":"MiTV", 
    "manufacturer":"Xiaomi",
    "version":3,
    "type":"TV", 
    "variables":{
        "MyStatus":"",
        "MyTVIP":"192.168.1.33",
        "PackageName":""
    },
    "labels":{
        "CurrentStatus" : {"label":"status", "listen":"MyStatus"}
    },
    "buttons":{
        "CURSOR LEFT": {"label":"", "type":"http-get", "command":"http://$MyTVIP:6095/controller?action=keyevent&keycode=left", "queryresult":"$.msg", "evalwrite":[{"variable":"MyStatus","value":"DYNAMIK (\"$Result\"==\"success\")?\"Left pressed\":\"Command Failed\""}]},
        "CURSOR RIGHT": {"label":"", "type":"http-get", "command":"http://$MyTVIP:6095/controller?action=keyevent&keycode=right", "queryresult":"$.msg", "evalwrite":[{"variable":"MyStatus","value":"DYNAMIK (\"$Result\"==\"success\")?\"Right pressed\":\"Command Failed\""}]},
 ```
 
 The beginning of this driver is quite boring, but the first thing you can notice is how the variable MyTVIP is used
.
Int the Get command: http://$MyTVIP:6095/controller?action=keyevent&keycode=left
The value of the IP will be immediately modified and replaced. So if you change the IP you need to change only in one place. You will see later that it enables quite complexe scenarios.
But now, let's focus of the most important part of this tutorial step :
#### queryresult
In order to understand query result, you need to understand the problem it solves. All the deivces we are trying to control are diverse, they speak different language, and most of the time they don't answer the way we want. Fortunately, most of the time they answer using a syntax called JSON (meta also supports XML, more on that later).
In order to understand an answer in json, that can be extremely long (the neeo brain answer with 1000s of characters), you need to navigate through it. JPATH is our friend for that.
So to be clear, if you are using an 'http-get' type of command, the queryresult will be a jpath.
Let's see what it means.
Going back to my MiTV, when I request the TV, it is answering with a weird thing:
```
{
"status":0,
"msg":"success",
"data":{}
}
```
Remember this format ? It is the same format used by our settings, the industry standard JSON. But it is too complex.
We don't want to deal with that. We need only to now what is inside the msg part if it is a success. So that we can know if our command has worked.
To simplify it we will filter using jpath (or jsonpath). 
Please have a look at this: https://github.com/dchester/jsonpath
It explains how to filter using jpath.
In our case, the jpath is "$.msg". When applied to the json quoted before, it returns.... 'success'. Which is exactly what we want.
In order to create a jpath yourself (it can be complexe, especially for example with a complex json like the brain), I strongly advice you to use an online evaluator: https://jsonpath.com/ (for example, there are many).
You copy your json returned in your browser, and aplly your path.

#### $Result 
So to complete what was said in the previous tuto, $Result is in fact the result of the command, filtered by the queryresult. In our MiTV, it gives something much simpler: success. We could directly apply this to the label, but let's make something a bit more complex.
#### evalwrite
Here, we use our friend evalwrite. We will assign to MyStatus, itself attached to the label.
What we will assign is : 
#### DYNAMIK (\"$Result\"==\"success\")?\"Left pressed\":\"Command Failed\"
This command looks a bit weird so let's have a closer look at it.
We first have DYNAMIK. DYNAMIK is our friend asking the dirver to interpret the string as javascript.
then lets have a look at the first part into brakets:
We are comparing to strings. Inside a DYNAMIK field, strings are always between 2 \". Why? Because we need to know the " is not a json one but part of the field, so we exit it as an external character. So as a conclusion, \"$Result\" means 'I want what is inside $Result and compare it as a string'. So we want to compare it to \"success\". The way to compare is '=='. It means, is it equal ? As you remember the normal result of the command should be 'success' so in this case, if the command works well, it will indeed be equal.
Going back to the global field, you can see it globally look likes that: a test ? something : somethingelse. As you remember, on the left side of the question mark is a condition, is success equal to success. Yes it is, so the result will be true. If it is true, the something will be chosen, if the result is false, the something else would be chosen. The test you can use are ==, <=, >=, <, >, != (not equal), and many others.
So basically as you start to understand, if the command return success, we will diplay Left pressed, if not, command failed.

Ok, we are all set for the second part of this tuto step.
```
"POWER ON": {"label":"", "type":"http-get", "command":"http://$MyTVIP:6095/controller?action=getinstalledapp&count=999&changeIcon=1", "queryresult":"$.msg", "evalwrite":[{"variable":"MyStatus","value":"DYNAMIK (\"$Result\"==\"success\")?\"Power is on\":\"Trying to Switch on by IR\""}], "evaldo":[{"test":"DYNAMIK \"$Result\"==\"success\"", "then":"", "or":"__POWER ON-IR"}]},
"__POWER ON-IR": {"label":"", "type":"http-get", "command":"http://192.168.1.26:3000/v1/projects/home/rooms/6394342251295670272/devices/6699143044186243072/macros/6699143044261740545/trigger", "queryresult":"$.msg", "evalwrite":[{"variable":"MyStatus","value":"DYNAMIK (\"$Result\"==\"success\")?\"Power Off\":\"Command Failed\""}]}
```
In this example, you can see something much more interresting than displaying 'left pressed' in the remote.
My MiTV doesn't understand WOL. But it understand IR. Unfortunately, it is the very same command to power on or power off the TV. So basically when I power on the recipe, sometimes it is powering on the TV, sometimes it switch off (making me very popular with my fammily :-).
So here is the trick. On the power on button, the first think I do is a basic command to the TV. If the TV is on, it should always be a success. If it is not, in the evalwrite I mention Trying to switch on by IR. In the evaldo, I do the same test, and then I launch another command. For your information this command is a neeo brain command launching an IR call using my broadlink driver (but could be any), then I throw an infra red call but being 100% sure that it never switch off the TV. 
NOTE: in order to get the exact text of any of your recipe, you could use the brain explorer of my meta. It is currently a bit raw but I will refine soon.

### Tutorial Step 4b - List component.

In this component we will start to learn the (by far) more complexe component of the neeo remote. It is also (by far) the coolest.
Let's analyse these somewhat cryptic lines:
```
"directories":{
    "Programs": {"label":"", "feeders": {
        "Programs":{"label":"", "commandset": [{"type":"http-get", "command":"http://$MyTVIP:6095/controller?action=getinstalledapp&count=999&changeIcon=1", "queryresult":"$.data.AppInfo[*]", "itemname":"DYNAMIK JSON.parse(\"$Result\").AppName", "itemlabel":"\"Android TV App\"", 
            "itemaction":"ProgramSet", "itemimage":"DYNAMIK JSON.parse(\"$Result\").IconURL", "evalwrite":[{"variable":"PackageName","value":"DYNAMIK JSON.parse(\"$Result\").PackageName"}]}]},
        "ProgramSet":{"label":"", "commandset": [{"type":"http-get", "command":"http://$MyTVIP:6095/controller?action=startapp&type=packagename&packagename=$PackageName"}]}
       }
    }
}
```
A Directory is basically a button calling a list. In this case, we will have one buttton, programs.
Then we have feeders. A feeder basically feed the list with data. In the feeder we decide what to feed and how to display (listitem and title for example). Finally we have also a special feeder for action to be done. Multiple feeders allow navigation among feeders. For example as you see in the volumio demo. (it frankly quite a nightmare to code but hey!, in the meta it is done for you :-).  
In this example we have 2 feeders, one to display the program, another to perform an action.
The first feeder (called programs also) trigger a command returning a gigantic JSON (cut here in order to save place)
```
{

"status":0,

"msg":"success",

"data":{"AppInfo":[{"PackageName":"com.archos.mediacenter.videofree","IconURL":"http:\/\/192.168.1.33:6095\/request?action=getResource&name=com.archos.mediacenter.videofree1.png","AppName":"Archos Video","Order":1},{"PackageName":"org.videolan.vlc","IconURL":"http:\/\/192.168.1.33:6095\/request?action=getResource&name=org.videolan.vlc1.png","AppName":"VLC","Order":2},{"PackageName":"com.mxtech.videoplayer.ad","IconURL":"http:\/\/192.168.1.33:6095\/request?action=getResource&name=com.mxtech.videoplayer.ad1.png","AppName":"MX Player","Order":3},{"PackageName":"com.cloudtv","IconURL":"http:\/\/192.168.1.33:6095\/request?action=getResource&name=com.cloudtv1.png","AppName":"OTT","Order":4},{"PackageName":"com.newtv.cboxtv","IconURL":"http:\/\/192.168.1.33:6095\/request?action=getResource&name=com.newtv.cboxtv1.png","AppName":"CCTV.新视听","Order":5},
```
What is interresting us are the values in the lines:
```
{"PackageName":"org.videolan.vlc","IconURL":"http:\/\/192.168.1.33:6095\/request?action=getResource&name=org.videolan.vlc1.png","AppName":"VLC","Order":2}
```
In order to get that we do the jsonpath: $.data.AppInfo[*]. 

It returns:
```
[
 {
   "PackageName": "com.archos.mediacenter.videofree",
   "IconURL": "http://192.168.1.33:6095/request?action=getResource&name=com.archos.mediacenter.videofree1.png",
   "AppName": "Archos Video",
   "Order": 1
 },
 {
   "PackageName": "org.videolan.vlc",
   "IconURL": "http://192.168.1.33:6095/request?action=getResource&name=org.videolan.vlc1.png",
   "AppName": "VLC",
   "Order": 2
 },
 ...
 ```
This is what we want. the VERY IMPORTANT point to note is that the value returned is an array. as you remember, an array is between [...].
SO basically, each lines of the list will be assigned one item of the table.
#### itemname
Item name is the name of the item displayed. The value we will choose is the appname attribute. In order to get it, we need to do :"DYNAMIK JSON.parse(\"$Result\").AppName"
Again something new here, but immensely useful, JSON.parse (case sensitive). The JSON.parse will read a small JSON expression and make the attributes and their value available.
#### itemlabel
A fixed label here.
#### itemimage
Url for the thumbnail beign displayed, we use the IconURL given by my TV.
#### itemaction
Here is the name of the next feeder performing the action, in our case, ProgramSet.
#### evalwrite
Here is our old friend evalwrite. It will be activated when we click on the line. Here it will help to persist the packagename. Because the packagename is used as an argument for the action we want to trigger.
#### action feeder
Action feeder is not really a feeder but the action triggered when we click on an item on the list.
In our case you see the following command.
http://$MyTVIP:6095/controller?action=startapp&type=packagename&packagename=$PackageName
You can recognised the $PackageName we have used. It will basically start the application in my TV we have choosen.
